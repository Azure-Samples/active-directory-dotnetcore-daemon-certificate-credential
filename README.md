# Authenticating to Azure AD v1.0 in daemon apps with certificates

 **There's a newer version of this sample taking advantage of the Microsoft identity platform** (formerly Azure AD v2.0) and MSAL.NET.

 Check it out: https://github.com/azure-samples/active-directory-dotnetcore-daemon-v2.

 If you really need to access this Azure AD v1.0 | ADAL.NET sample, you can navigate to the [master](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnetcore-daemon-certificate-credential/tree/master) branch, but please know that it's no longer supported.
